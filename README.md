"# WishVerse" 

My CS50's Final Project is a CRUD web application where the user can log in and build his/her shop wish list when he/she travels to the USA.
The application will automatically add the 6% tax and convert the US dollar to his/her actual currency.

This is a very personal project because on February 24, I will travel to Orlando, FL, with my family for the first time, and I want to organize and prepare myself for the trip, and how much money I will have to take with me.

Since I live in Brazil, the currency conversion for me will be from USD to BRL (_Brazilian real_), but the user will have the option to change from any to any currency as he likes.
The user will be able to add, update, or remove any item he wants, put the item's links, prices, quantity, description or observation, and favorite it.
