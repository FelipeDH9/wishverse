#### Description:
My CS50's Final Project is a CRUD web application where the user can log in and build his/her shop wish list when he/she travels to the USA.
The application will automatically add the 6% tax and convert the US dollar to his/her actual currency.

This is a very personal project because on February 24, I will travel to Orlando, FL, with my family for the first time, and I want to organize and prepare myself for the trip, and how much money I will have to take with me.

Since I live in Brazil, the currency conversion for me will be from USD to BRL (_Brazilian real_), but the user will have the option to change from any to any currency as he/she likes.
The user will be able to add, update, or remove any item he wants, put the item link, price, quantity, brand and name, informations, and favorite it.
